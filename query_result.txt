Based on the provided summaries, here are the physics or chemistry violations spotted in the video:

1.  **Nuclear Meltdown Without Nuclear Material:** The video questions the feasibility of a nuclear meltdown occurring within the van, as depicted in the Simpsons clip, specifically pointing out the lack of necessary nuclear material or vapors for such an event (00:01:03).
2.  **Incorrect Melting/Vaporization Order:** The analysis highlights that the ground appears to vaporize *before* the van melts. It explains that the temperature needed to vaporize rock is significantly higher than the melting point of steel, meaning the van should have melted first (00:01:41). Evidence supporting this includes a table comparing melting/vaporization points (00:01:46).
3.  **Selective Vaporization:** The ground under the van is shown vaporizing, yet cars parked nearby on the street remain unaffected, violating principles of heat transfer and effect radius (00:01:51).
4.  **Survival in Extreme Heat:** Homer is depicted as surviving the event that supposedly vaporized the ground beneath him. Furthermore, his clothes and watch remain intact instead of being destroyed or reduced to atoms by the implied extreme temperatures (00:01:56).
5.  **Unrealistic Escape Pod Trajectory:** Mr. Burns' escape pod is shown ricocheting around the town in a way that defies realistic physics (00:01:29).
