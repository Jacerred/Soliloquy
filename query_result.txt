Based on the provided summaries, here are the violations of physics, chemistry, or related scientific principles spotted by the video:

1.  **Geological Inaccuracy:** An earthquake occurs in Springfield, which the video claims is supposed to be in Florida. Florida is not a seismically active region known for earthquakes (0:45 - 0:55).
2.  **Nuclear Physics/Chemistry Violation:** A nuclear meltdown is depicted happening inside an inspection van, apparently without any nuclear material present, which is impossible (1:05). The meltdown is also shown without emitting vapors, which is inconsistent with the extreme heat involved (1:05).
3.  **Mechanics/Dynamics Violation:** An escape pod, after falling downwards, inexplicably rebounds horizontally to the right, violating principles of momentum and expected collision physics (1:30).
4.  **Thermodynamics/Material Science Violation:** The inspection van sinks into the ground by supposedly vaporizing the rock layers beneath it (1:35). The video points out that the van, likely made of steel, should melt at temperatures far lower than those required to vaporize rock. Therefore, the van should have melted before the rock vaporized (1:46).
5.  **Radiation Physics & Effects Violation:** Radiation is seemingly depicted as a visible fluorescent green glow, which is a common but inaccurate trope (1:56). Furthermore, Homer survives conditions extreme enough to vaporize rock with his clothes and watch intact, which is physically implausible given the implied temperatures and radiation levels (1:56).
