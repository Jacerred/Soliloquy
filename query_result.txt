Based on the provided summaries, here's what's wrong with the van in *The Simpsons* according to the video and why it defies physics/chemistry:

1.  **What's wrong with the van:** The video shows the nuclear inspection van sinking cleanly into the ground (1:39) and eventually disappearing completely, leaving only Homer behind (1:56).

2.  **Why it defies physics/chemistry:** The video points this out as a science error (mentioned in the overall summary for the second chunk, starting at 1:22). It then displays a data table showing melting and vaporizing temperatures (1:50). This implies that the intense heat, presumably from the nuclear material or meltdown associated with the glowing van (1:04), should cause the ground beneath it to melt or vaporize, rather than allowing the solid van to simply sink through solid ground as depicted. The clean sinking and disappearance without interacting realistically (melting/vaporizing the ground) defies the expected physical and chemical interactions based on temperature.
