Based on the video descriptions provided:

The two teams playing are **Homestead** (wearing light blue and white uniforms) and **the Spartans** (wearing blue and yellow/gold uniforms).

This identification is supported by the segment starting at 02:05, which explicitly names Homestead as the team in light blue and white and their opponents as the Spartans in blue and yellow (02:05). The initial segment also describes the teams by these colors (00:00), and a later segment again refers to the team in blue and gold (04:09), consistent with the Spartans' description.
