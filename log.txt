This video is a comedic breakdown of a Simpsons scene involving a nuclear inspection van melting through the ground. The video highlights the scene's scientific inaccuracies and then gives the viewer a quiz with questions about chemistry and physics. The video then concludes with a rickroll and a stick bug.

00:00
The nuclear inspection van melts into the parking lot.

00:05
The melting point of steel is compared to the temperature to vaporize rocks. The video concludes that the van should have melted first.

00:10
Homer is still alive after the van vaporizes into the ground. The presenter comments how Homer should have been reduced to atoms, but it is fluorescent and not radiation.

00:15
The narrator then presents the viewer a pop quiz.

00:20
Questions one and two are presented

00:25
Questions three and four are presented

00:30
Questions five and six are presented

00:35
Question seven is presented, and then the video asks if the viewers know what doesn't violate physics and chemistry.

00:40
The video RickRolls the viewers.

00:45
A "technical difficulty" image flashes on the screen before the video reveals it was a blooper and they actually "stickbug" the viewer

00:50
The video then shows what should have happened to the nuclear inspection van.
